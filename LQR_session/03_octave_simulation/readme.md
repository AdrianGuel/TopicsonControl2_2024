# Seesaw rotational dynamics Simulation: Nonlinear vs Linearized Dynamics

This repository provides a simulation and visualization framework in **GNU Octave** for analyzing a physical balancing beam system under both **nonlinear** and **linearized** dynamic models. It includes animated plots, phase-space analysis, and an interactive vector field visualization to understand the differences between models and dynamic behavior near equilibrium points.

## üìä Features

- Simulates both nonlinear and linearized ODE models of a rotating beam.
- 3D animation of the physical system, showing real-time angular motion of both models.
- Plots of angular velocity and angular position over time.
- Phase space visualization with optional vector field (linear or nonlinear).
- Interactive GUI to toggle between vector fields.
- Legend and color-coded trajectories for comparison clarity.

## üîß Modifiable Parameters

You can easily customize the behavior of the system by modifying the following variables at the top of the script:

| Variable        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `m1`, `m2`      | Masses located at each end of the beam (in kg). |
| `L`             | Length of the beam (in meters). |
| `g`             | Gravitational acceleration. |
| `b`             | Viscous damping coefficient. |
| `u_c`           | Coulomb friction coefficient. |
| `u`             | Control torque applied (defaults to 0). |
| `eps`           | Smoothing parameter for tanh (used in nonlinear damping). |
| `theta_e`       | Linearization point (angle in radians). |
| `theta_e_dot`   | Linearization point (angular velocity in rad/s). |
| `x0`            | Initial state `[theta; theta_dot]`. |
| `tspan`         | Time vector for simulation, i.e. `linspace(t_start, t_end, N)`. |
| `animation_step`| Step size for the animation frame update. |

## üìÅ File Overview

### Main Script

- **Section 1: System Parameters**  
  Defines physical constants, beam masses, damping, gravity, and precomputed constants.

- **Section 2: Model Definitions**
  - **Nonlinear ODE**: Full dynamics using damping and cosine torque.
  - **Linearized ODE**: Approximated model around a user-defined equilibrium point.

- **Section 3: Simulation Setup**
  Time vector and initial conditions. Integrates the systems using `ode45`.

- **Section 4: Plotting and Animation**
  Creates four plots:
  1. Angular velocity over time `x'(t) vs t`.
  2. Phase space `x'(t)` vs `x(t)` with switchable vector field.
  3. 3D animated beam showing physical movement.
  4. Angular position over time `t vs x(t)` (rotated plot).

- **Section 5: Interactivity**
  A GUI dropdown menu allows toggling between the vector fields of the nonlinear and linear models on the phase space plot.

- **Section 6: Animation Loop**
  Updates all figures simultaneously: 3D beam, time responses, and phase plot markers.

## üß† Mathematical Models

### Nonlinear Model:
$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{\theta} = \omega \\
\dot{\omega} = -a \omega - b \tanh\left(\frac{\omega}{\varepsilon}\right) + c \cos(\theta)
\end{cases}
$$

### Linearized Model:
Linearization around $\theta_e, \omega_e$:
$$
\dot{x} = A x + B u
$$

Where:
- $x = [\theta - \theta_e; \omega - \omega_e]$
- $A$ is computed using symbolic derivatives.

## üìå Dependencies

This script uses GNU Octave and requires the **symbolic** package. You can install it with:
```octave
pkg install -forge symbolic
pkg load symbolic
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

Simply execute the script in GNU Octave. All figures will be generated, and the animation will run in real time. Use the dropdown menu on the top-right corner to toggle between the linear and nonlinear vector fields in the phase space.

Feel free to fork and adapt the script to different systems or to extend it with controllers (e.g., LQR, PID) or measurement noise to simulate real-world scenarios.

Enjoy simulating dynamics!
